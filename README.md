This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from several newspapers and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated in the news articles.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a **web scraping** method that gets the latest news from the newspapers, and an **interactive web application** that shows the obtained results to the user.

The web application can be used at https://lnclass.herokuapp.com.

The full detailed process is explained in the **report**(https://github.com/miguelfzafra/Latest-News-Classifier/blob/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/09.%20Report/Latest%20News%20Classifier.pdf). Following it and the different notebooks should be necessary for reaching a  full understanding of the project.
